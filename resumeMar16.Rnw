\textbf{Data Scientist} & I have always been fascinated by numbers, classifications, data. I studied Maths and specialized in Statistics. Early in my career I worked for the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE) then, in 2012 I joined the Statistics Department of the IMF. Since November 2015 I work as a Data Scientist at the World Bank. Overall about 15 years of experience working with data.\\[3pt]
\textbf{Innovative in data visualization} & I constantly search for innovative ways of presenting data. I have broad experience in Web content design, presentations, \href{https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/reports}{data reports}, \href{https://alberto-sanchez-rodelgo.shinyapps.io/datascoper/}{charts}, newsletters and \href{https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/things-do-trade-and-competitiveness-data-thank-you-api}{blogs}.\\[3pt]
\textbf{Data Analyst \& Algorithms} & In my first job for a financial startup, I modeled intraday stocks market trading. At INE, I used SAS to optimize resource allocation for Data Collection Surveys. I was the analytics and R expert at the IMF's Statistics Department. At the Bank I build models and present data driven business solutions. I keep abreast of the developments in Data Science and Machine Learning and I participate in machine learning competitions and \href{https://alberto-sanchez-rodelgo.shinyapps.io/GameOfTrades/}{sports analytics conferences (MIT Sloan)}.\\[3pt]
\textbf{Data Infrastructures} & I deployed the first ever shiny-server and Connect to help the R research community in the Bank. As an example: \href{https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/things-do-trade-and-competitiveness-data-thank-you-api}{TCdatascoper}. I have vast experience with statistical standards (SDMX, GSBPM, GSIM), and contributed papers on the Generic Statistical Business Model (GSIM) \\[3pt]
\textbf{Skilled R and Shiny programmer} & I mostly work in R but I also have coding experience in Java: \href{http://www.ine.es/geotempus/?L=1}{Geo Statistics}, C++, Python, Visual basic, SAS and SQL. I have broad experience with Microsoft Business Analysis tools.\\[3pt]
\textbf{Database and Web designer} & Extensive experience with relational databases. My major accomplishment was leading the creation of INE's new Dissemination Database, along with its API and portfolio of Web Applications. Examples of my work: \href{http://www.ine.es/FichasWeb/Welcome.do?L=1}{Geo Statistics}, \href{http://www.ine.es/ss/Satellite?L=es_ES&c=INEmasNoticia_C&cid=1259943920296&idp=1254736092090&pagename=masINE\%2FmasLayout}{Web Magazine}. At the Bank I manage \href{https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/}{TCdata360} \\[3pt]
\textbf{Mentor \& Problem Solver} & It's a great safisfaction to be able to help my colleagues. Either advising data science projects, solving R \& Shiny questions, suggesting good data visualization practices or explaining statistical models. I also have managerial experience: At INE I managed a team of 12 staff. Currently I am the data lead in my unit.\\
